				<h2>Founding</h2>

				<pre>	Upon returning from the Civil war, town founder John Major settled here with his wife, Julia, and his daughter, Anna. He bought land in Platte and Lake townships as investments and, in late 1854, purchased the 122 acres from Orange and Sally Ridson of Saline, MI, for the initial settlement.<br>	He then cleared twenty acres, built a modest log cabin, and planted black locust trees along with an apple orchard.</pre>
				<h2>The Sawmill's Creation</h2>
				<pre><br>	Lumber speculators soon arrived seeking white pine, though the local forest was primarily hardwood. Dr. Arthur O'Leary recognized the financial potential and hired Charles T. Wright to manage the mill operation.<br>	The original mill was on the South side of Pine Creek. The creek was dammed to create a mill pond right in front of the mill. Logs were sent down the creek to the mill pond, then lifted up a ramp by a steam-powered chain loop, which also ran the saw on the second floor.</pre>
