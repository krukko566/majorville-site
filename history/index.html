        <h2>Founding</h2>

        <pre>	Upon returning from the Civil war, town founder John Major settled here with his wife, Julia, and his daughter, Anna. He bought land in Platte and Lake townships as investments and, in late 1854, purchased the 122 acres from Orange and Sally Ridson of Saline, MI, for the initial settlement.<br>	He then cleared twenty acres, built a modest log cabin, and planted black locust trees and an apple orchard.<br></pre>
